    <h3>CEO</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone!, I am so excited to be part of this great gathering of great minds taken part in this wonderful
        class of WDD130. I am John Anochirionye from the Eastern part of Nigeria. Currently living in the city of
        Owerri.</p> My friends call me TheCEO or simply AJohn or JohnDalton. I am single, a member of the Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for over 20 years. I am a returned missionary, served in Nigeria Lagos-West
    Mission. I currently served as the stake technology specialist in my stake, as well as the ward clerk in my local
    ward</p>
    <p>I am a BYU PathwayConnect completer and currently enrolled in BYU-Idaho online course, seeking a degree in
        applied technology.</p> Learning web development and being a software engineering interest me and feel I will be
    more self reliant haven these skills to better provide for myself and others. This is my main goal in venturing into
    this course. I believe I will gain the required knowlege about web development at the end of this course. I love to
    play chess and scrabble gamse, surf the internet, meet with friends and watch football.</p>
    <p>I am open to making new friends who can actively collaborate with me in this course work and other business or
        career projects.</p>
